Hello, and welcome on my home page!

I am a **software engineer**, since I graduated from the [INSA Lyon](http://www.insa-lyon.fr/en), one of the most prestigious French engineering universities, in July 2009.

I currently work for [Multicom](http://www.multicom.co.uk/), a software editor, in Bristol (UK).

You can find on this website my personal information, where to find me on the internet, how to contact me...
