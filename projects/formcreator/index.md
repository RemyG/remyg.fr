This project is an HTML/Javascript application, meant to be used as a development help.

[**View demo &raquo;**](http://formcreator.remyg.fr)

I often need to simulate HTTP POST requests, and it's always a real pain to paste the parameters in a text editor, delete all the useless text, create an input tag for each parameter, then save the file as an HTML page and open it in a browser.

That's what FormCreator is meant to do. It won't create a nice form, but it will parse the parameters you put in and transform them into hidden inputs, so you can test your HTTP request.

## Usage

* Put the action of the request in the "Action" input.
* Select the method of the request (POST/GET) in the "Method" list.
* Put the format of the parameters in the field "Paremeters as Regex". It should contain two strings (.+?), used for the parameters names and their values. Currently, the parameter name must appear before its value.
