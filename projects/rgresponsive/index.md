This project is a responsive Wordpress theme. I've started to work on this because I wanted to standardize the general aspect of my different websites ([my blog](http://blog.remyg.fr) and [the blog of my developments](github.remyg.fr)).

You can find the sources for this theme [on GitHub](https://github.com/RemyG/wordpress-rgresponsive) (you can also directly download [the Zip archive](https://github.com/RemyG/wordpress-rgresponsive/archive/master.zip)).

The complete documentation to create a Wordpress theme can be found [here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development).

The font used in this theme is [Roboto](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Roboto).

When developing a theme, there are 2 very useful plugins:

* [theme-check](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/), which runs tests on your theme and compare it to the Wordpress standards and practices,
* [toolbar-theme-switcher](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/toolbar-theme-switcher/), which allows you to switch between your installed themes from the toolbar.

The Wordpress Codex also provides [some test data](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test) that you can import by using the [wordpress-importer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-importer/) plugin. The test data contains a large number of posts, pages and comments, from almost every type/format. After importing and configuring your blog for the unit tests, you can check that everything is behaving as expected.

I will continue to update this page as I work on the theme.
