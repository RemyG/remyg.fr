This project is a responsive Wordpress theme based on Twitter Bootstrap. I've created this theme to standardize the aspect of my [personnal website](http://remyg.fr) on Jekyll and my [Wordpress blog](http://blog.remyg.fr).

[**View demo &raquo;**](http://blog.remyg.fr)

You can find the sources for this theme [on GitHub](https://github.com/RemyG/RGWordstrap) (you can also directly download [the Zip archive](https://github.com/RemyG/RGWordstrap/archive/master.zip)).

I will continue to update this page as I work on the theme.
